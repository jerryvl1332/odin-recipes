    <p>Steamed rice is a classic, perfect to go with the other 2 dishes posted on the previous page!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><ul>
      <li>2 cups (370 grams) jasmine rice or short grain rice</li>
      <li>2 cups (480ml) water for a rice cooker</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Rice cooker method</h3>
    <p><ol>
      <li>Start by first washing the rice. In a deep bowl cover the rice with tap water, swirling and rubbing the grains between your hands then drain the water. The water will be cloudy with starch, repeat this process until the water runs clearer (about 2 to 3 times).</li>
      <li>After the rice is washed, place the rice into the rice cooker and cover with 2 cups of water. Turn the rice cooker on.</li>
      <li>Let the rice cooker do the work, afterit has finished cooking let the rice sit for 8 to 10 minutes before serving so it becomes fluffer.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <h3>Stove top method</h3>
    <p><ol>
      <li>Repeat the washing process as listed above.</li>
      <li>After the rice is washed place into a heavy bottomed pot and cover with 3 cups of water. Turn your stove onto high heat.</li>
      <li>Bring to a rolling boil, then stir the rice a few times to dislodge the grains from the bottom of the pot. Continue boiling for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>After this 5 minutes cover the pot and drop the heat to as low as you can. Leave this slowly steam for 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>After the steaming time is up uncover the pot to check the grains. If you still notice some water, cover again and let it steam for another minute or so. Check again and if all water has been absorbed, fluff the rice and serve!</li>
